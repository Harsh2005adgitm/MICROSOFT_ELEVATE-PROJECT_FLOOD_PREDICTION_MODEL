# PROBLEM STATEMENT  

Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters in India, causing loss of lives, destruction of property, and significant economic damage every year. Accurate and early flood prediction is critical to help authorities and communities take preventive measures and minimize disaster impacts.

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of flooding in a given area using three key environmental factors:

🌧️ Rainfall (mm)

🌊 River Water Level (m)

🌱 Soil Moisture (%)
